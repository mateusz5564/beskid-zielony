## About

Once upon a time, I decided that I want to give Next.js a try and practice web development on a real project. I found a page of a local tourism organization that was kinda old and broken. The characteristics of this page made it a perfect fit to use Next.js. Then I found some resources on web design, and I used Figma to project the website. I started turning my Figma file into a working app utilizing Next.js, Styled Components, Strapi as headless CMS, and some other technologies listed below. Also, I didn't forget about a11y, e.g. implemented a keyboard trap on the mobile menu and tested the app with a screen reader.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
