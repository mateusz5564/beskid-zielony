## About

Once upon a time, I decided that I want to give Next.js a try and practice web development on a real project. I found a page of a local tourism organization that was kinda old and broken. The characteristics of this page made it a perfect fit to use Next.js. Then I found some resources on web design, and I used Figma to project the website. I started turning my Figma file into a working app utilizing Next.js, Styled Components, Strapi as headless CMS, and some other technologies listed below. Also, I didn't forget about a11y, e.g. implemented a keyboard trap on the mobile menu and tested the app with a screen reader.

## Important

Heroku removed its free tier, so the app has no longer Headless CMS hosted, but since I used Next.js(SSG) the app still works, we just can't update it anymore by generating a new build triggered by a change of the data in Strapi. 

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Styled Compontents
- Strapi
- Swiper js
- A11y
